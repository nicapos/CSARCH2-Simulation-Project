# IEEE-754 Decimal-32 floating-point converter

A web-based IEEE-754 Decimal-32 floating-point converter that can convert decimal and base-10 inputs (up to 7 digits and more) into binary output with spaces between sections, hexadecimal equivalent, and with the option to output the results to a text file. 

This converter can handle all special cases, including NaN input, and provides the user with the ability to choose their preferred rounding method.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This repository contains the front-end of the simulation project. The repository for the back-end can be found [here](https://github.com/nicapos/CSARCH2-Simulation-Project-backend).
